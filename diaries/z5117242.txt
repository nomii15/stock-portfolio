Week 1

Our group was formed in Week 1. As a group, we decided to undertake the stock portfolio app project. I volunteered to be the scrum master.
I made the Jira instance and Jira project for our COMP3900 project. As a group, we discussed what features we wanted to have in our stock portfolio project.

Week 2

Before our meeting, I discussed with our Git maintainer Melanie to discuss what Git workflow we wanted to undertake, as I began preparing a Git workflow tutorial.
I also set up our proposal document and began working on the proposal. I was the scribe to the document as the team discussed what our project requirements were.
We also discussed what epic stories we wanted to have. We assigned epic stories to each member to write respective user stories, before our next meeting. I wrote
4 user stories for the epic story regarding user social interaction. I also worked on defining the problem domain, competitors and what they lack as well as 
organising the sprint times.
